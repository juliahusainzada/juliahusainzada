Check out my team's project repository for the real-world ML project we worked on for KPMG for over 3 months, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio!
- Analyzed 40,000+ zip codes and 3,000+ donations for C5LA using CRISP-DM framework and Agile methodology
- Achieved 88% accuracy with Random Forest model, selected features with RFE, optimized parameters with RandomizedSearchCV , applied preprocessing and trend analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Presented findings and actionable recommendations to KPMG staff and C5LA to improve donor retention

### 2. [Equitable AI for Dermatology (Break Through Tech AI Program ‚Äì Spring 2025)](https://github.com/juliahusainzada/equitable-ai-dermatology)
- Led all exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a Kaggle competition focused on building a fair computer vision model to classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones.
- Conducted fairness-driven analysis using the Fitzpatrick skin tone scale and visualized class imbalances across 21 medical skin conditions.
- Insights from my EDA guided fairness-aware model development to address bias and healthcare disparities in dermatological AI.
